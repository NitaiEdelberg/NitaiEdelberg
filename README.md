# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nitai Edelberg

I'm a second-year computer science student at Ben Gurion University in Israel. My passion lies in algorithms, data structures, and programming systems. I've worked on projects in Java, C++, and even set up a TFTP server. Here's a bit more about me:

## Languages and Tools

- **Java**: My go-to language for building robust applications.
- **C++**: I enjoy the low-level control and performance optimization it offers.
- **TypeScript**: I've dabbled in TypeScript, especially for web development.
- **Git**: Version control is my best friend.
- **Linux**: I'm comfortable working with Linux, especially for C projects.
- **Functional Programming**: I love exploring functional paradigms, and TypeScript lets me do that.

## Projects

- Project 1: A Java-based web app for managing tasks.
- Project 2: A C++ library for efficient data manipulation.
- Project 3: A TypeScript project using Ramda for functional magic.
