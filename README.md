I'm a Third-year computer science student at Ben Gurion University in Israel. My passion is algorithms, solving problems, and programming . I've worked on projects in Java, C++, and even set up a TFTP server and client. Here's a bit more about me:

## Languages and Tools

- **Java**: My go-to language for building robust applications.
- **C++**: I enjoy the low-level control and performance optimization it offers.
- **TypeScript**: I've dabbled in TypeScript, especially for functional development.
- **Python**: I've learned python alone, and tried Django web building and ML libraries
- **Git**: I co-worked with friends on projects.
- **Linux**: I'm comfortable working with Linux, especially for C projects.
- **Functional Programming**: I love exploring functional paradigms, and TypeScript lets me do that.

## Projects

- Project 1: A C++-based program app for managing orders in a Warehouse.
- Project 2: A Java set game using the Multi-threading method.
- Project 3: Tftp Server-Client program.
