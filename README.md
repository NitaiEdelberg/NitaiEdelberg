I'm a Third-year computer science student at Ben Gurion University in Israel. My passion is algorithms, solving problems, and programming . I've worked on projects in Java, C++, and even set up a TFTP server and client. Here's a bit more about me:

## Languages and Tools

- **Java**: My go-to language. I used it to develop a Multi-threading paradigm and to work with servers. I find it ideal for OOP programming 
- **Python**: I've learned python by my own, and experinced in bulding a web app with Django and playing with ML libraries. I enjoy progrming in python becouse it offers many useful libraries and frameworks and the syntax is much more english-like
- **C++**: I enjoy the low-level control and performance optimization it offers.
- **C**: I experinced in many linux apps like anti-virus,encoder, and linux shells to get to know better low-level computing concepts and hardware. worked also with assembly language
- **TypeScript**: I've dabbled in TypeScript, especially for functional development.
- **Git**: I co-worked with friends on projects.
- **Linux**: I'm comfortable working with Linux, especially for C projects.
- **Functional Programming**: I love exploring functional paradigms, and TypeScript lets me do that.

## Projects

- Project 1: A C++-based program app for managing orders in a Warehouse.
- Project 2: A Java set game using the Multi-threading method.
- Project 3: Tftp Server-Client program.
- C Projects:
  
    Project 1: Linux-shell Encoder
    Project 2: working Anti-Virus based on signituers files
